Sample from https://github.com/wasmerio/c-http-server

## Compile

Due to [the latest version of emscripten isn't supported](https://spectrum.chat/wasmer/runtime/the-latest-version-of-emscripten-isnt-supported~8dcf28b0-c1e5-4154-8668-91642031bc94) by wasmer, using the older version to compile in Dockerfile.
